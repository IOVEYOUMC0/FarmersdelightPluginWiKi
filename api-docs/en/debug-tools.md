# Debug tools — `DebugToolExtension` and `DebugToolRegistry`

FarmersDelight has an admin command, `/fd debugtools`, for stress-testing: mass-place blocks, mass-activate
them so they actually tick, inspect live state, validate loaded recipes, and undo the placement. The two types in
`com.huidu.farmersdelight.api.util` let an addon plug its own block into that command instead of shipping a
debug CLI of its own.

The feature id is `debug-tools`.

Use `/fd stats profile 200 all` to measure feature timings. Replace `all` with `handheld`,
`handheld_display`, `cooking_pot`, `skillet` or `stove` to select one feature. Release builds support
this command too. See [performance troubleshooting](../../server-guide/en/troubleshooting.md) for
timing boundaries and interpretation. Debug builds use the `-debug.jar` suffix; install either the
release or debug jar, never both. `/fd perf` always aliases `/fd stats`.

Debug builds can create a small, local test load manually:

```text
/fd debugtools test cooking_pot 64 200
/fd debugtools test skillet 64 200
/fd debugtools test stove 64 200
/fd debugtools test all 128 600
```

The command places stations near the player, fills their test state, and starts a matching profile. It processes at most 16 positions per slice so the command does not occupy the server thread for one long operation. `count` is the number of positions and `ticks` is the profile duration (20-12000). Use `/fd debugtools undo` to remove the latest batch and `/fd debugtools stop` to stop an unfinished placement, activation, or handheld test. `all` covers cooking pots, placed skillets and stoves.

For handheld cooking, hold a skillet in the main hand and campfire-cookable food in the off hand near a heat source, then run `/fd debugtools test handheld 1 200`. It does not replace either held item; it starts the real handheld session and samples it. Cooking still consumes the ingredient and delivers the result normally. The session stops automatically when the profile window ends; stop holding right click or use `/fd debugtools stop` to end it early. `undo` does not clean handheld state.

The `recipe validate` action checks loaded cooking-pot and cutting-board recipes for empty structure,
missing results/containers, and tags that resolve to no vanilla, CraftEngine, or registered common-tag
members. Parse failures are still reported by the normal `recipe.load_failed` logger.

## Availability: this only runs on a debug build

`/fd debugtools` exists only in the debug build of FarmersDelight; on a normal release build the command class
is absent from the jar and the command is never registered. Test your integration on a debug build. On a
release build the registry is mostly **dormant**: `register` still works and nothing ever calls your `place`,
`activate` or `cleanupBeforeUndo`. `status` is the exception — it is invoked by the always-resident
`/fd stats addon` subcommand, which works even on a release build.

That is why registering unconditionally is safe, and why both FDAddonTemplate and BrewinAndChewin do exactly
that in `onEnable` without probing anything.

## `DebugToolRegistry`

```java
package com.huidu.farmersdelight.api.util;

@ApiStatus.NonExtendable
public final class DebugToolRegistry {

    public static void register(DebugToolExtension extension);
    public static void unregister(String name);
    @Nullable public static DebugToolExtension find(String name);
    public static Collection<String> registeredNames();
    public static Collection<DebugToolExtension> all();
}
```

A static, process-wide `ConcurrentHashMap` keyed by the lowercased extension name. Notes:

- `register` is idempotent — re-registering the same name replaces the previous extension. `null`
  extensions, and extensions whose `name()` is `null`, are ignored.
- `unregister(name)` must be called from your `onDisable`. The map is static and survives your plugin's
  classloader, so a stale entry keeps a torn-down manager reachable and will be invoked on the next
  `/fd debugtools` run.
- `find` returns `null` for an unknown or `null` name. `registeredNames()` and `all()` return unmodifiable
  views; `registeredNames()` is what feeds the command's tab-completion.

```java
@Override
public void onEnable() {
    // ...
    DebugToolRegistry.register(new ExampleDebugExtension(this));
}

@Override
public void onDisable() {
    DebugToolRegistry.unregister("example_block");
}
```

## `DebugToolExtension`

```java
package com.huidu.farmersdelight.api.util;

@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly
public interface DebugToolExtension {

    String name();

    int place(Player player, Location origin, int count, int spacing, int layers, UndoSink undo);

    @FunctionalInterface
    interface UndoSink {
        void capture(Location loc);
    }

    default int activate(Player player) { return 0; }

    default List<String> status(Player player) { return List.of(); }

    default void cleanupBeforeUndo(Location location) { }
}
```

`@ApiStatus.OverrideOnly` means the opposite of `NonExtendable`: you are expected to implement this interface,
but you must not call its methods yourself — FarmersDelight is the only caller. Treat the implementation as a
callback surface.

### `String name()`

The lowercase target keyword. It becomes the word an admin types:

```
/fd debugtools place keg 64 2 3
```

It is also used for tab-completion and as the extension name in `/fd stats addon <name>`. `DebugToolRegistry`
lowercases it on registration, so return it already lowercase to avoid surprises.

### `int place(Player player, Location origin, int count, int spacing, int layers, UndoSink undo)`

Called for `/fd debugtools place <name> [count] [spacing] [layers]` when `<name>` is not one of
FarmersDelight's built-in targets. Return how many blocks actually went into the world.

The command lays out the grid itself and calls `place(...)` once per prepared cell, so every call receives:

- `count`, `spacing` and `layers` all equal to `1` for that cell;
- `origin` one block **below** the prepared cell — fill `origin` raised by one on Y;
- an undo batch already open, so every `undo.capture(...)` you make joins it.

The grid comes from the admin's `count` / `spacing` / `layers` arguments, and the number of prepared cells is
capped by `max-place-count`, so one command can never ask you for more blocks than that. The cell is empty and
editable, and a capture aimed at anything else is rejected. Fill the cell, return how many blocks actually went
into the world, and the placement pattern inside it is yours to decide.

Call `undo.capture(loc)` **before** mutating each target block. `UndoSink` is a functional interface with a
single `capture(Location)`; FarmersDelight snapshots the block state at that location into the current undo
batch, so `/fd debugtools undo` can restore it. Captures that turn out not to change state are silently
no-op'd on undo.

BrewinAndChewin's keg implementation, trimmed:

```java
@Override
public int place(Player player, Location origin, int count, int spacing, int layers, UndoSink undo) {
    if (player == null || origin == null || origin.getWorld() == null) return 0;
    BlockDefinition kegBlock = CraftEngineBlocks.byId(KEG_BLOCK);
    if (kegBlock == null) {
        player.sendMessage("§c[BAC] keg block not registered with CraftEngine.");
        return 0;
    }

    int grid = Math.max(1, (int) Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(count)));
    int total = count * Math.max(1, layers);
    int placed = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {
        int layer = i / count;
        int layerIndex = i % count;
        Location loc = new Location(
                origin.getWorld(),
                origin.getBlockX() + (layerIndex % grid) * spacing,
                origin.getBlockY() + 1 + layer,
                origin.getBlockZ() + (layerIndex / grid) * spacing);
        Block target = loc.getBlock();
        if (target.getType() != Material.AIR
                && !BlockStateUtils.isReplaceable(BlockStateUtils.getBlockState(target))) {
            continue;
        }
        if (undo != null) undo.capture(loc);
        if (CraftEngineBlocks.place(loc, kegBlock.defaultState(), false)) {
            placed++;
        }
    }
    return placed;
}
```

Note the `undo != null` guard — defensive, since the command always supplies a sink today.

### `int activate(Player player)`

Optional; default returns 0. Called for `/fd debugtools activate <name>`, and **also for every registered
extension** when the admin runs `/fd debugtools activate all`. Fill your placed blocks with sample state so
they start ticking, fermenting, cooking — whatever makes them load-bearing for a profiling run — and return
how many blocks transitioned to an active state. The count is added to the command's total.

FDAddonTemplate keeps its own `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()` of placed locations because its demo block has
no manager. If your plugin already has a manager that tracks its blocks (as BrewinAndChewin's `KegManager`
does), iterate that instead of duplicating tracking.

### `List<String> status(Player player)`

Optional; default returns an empty list. Called by the **always-resident** `/fd stats addon <name>` subcommand
(the `/fd stats` overview lists every registered addon as a clickable name that drills into it), so it runs on a
release build too. Each entry is one line, sent to the player by filling the
`{line}` placeholder of the translation key `command.stats_addon_line` (`{name}` is the extension name); the
line carries whatever prefix it has itself.

```java
@Override
public List<String> status(Player player) {
    return List.of("tracked example_blocks (debug-placed): " + placed.size());
}
```

Because each line is slotted into the `command.stats_addon_line` template, avoid a literal `{line}` or `{name}`
in your text — they are treated as placeholders. Put any prefix/colour inside your own line or in that translation
key.

Returning `null` is tolerated (treated as "no lines"), but an empty list is the documented way to opt out.

### `void cleanupBeforeUndo(Location location)`

Optional; default no-op. Called during `/fd debugtools undo` for **every restored location**, before the block
data is reverted. Use it to release in-memory tracking and remove block-entity NBT belonging to your
extension, so an undone placement does not leak ghost state.

Two properties of the call site are worth knowing:

- It is invoked on **every registered extension**, not just the one that placed the block. Your
  implementation must no-op cheaply when the location is not one of yours.
- Exceptions are caught and swallowed (`catch (Throwable ignored)`), so a bug here fails silently rather than
  aborting the undo. Log your own errors if you want to see them.

```java
@Override
public void cleanupBeforeUndo(Location location) {
    if (location == null) return;
    Iterator<Location> it = placed.iterator();
    while (it.hasNext()) {
        Location loc = it.next();
        if (loc.getBlockX() == location.getBlockX()
                && loc.getBlockY() == location.getBlockY()
                && loc.getBlockZ() == location.getBlockZ()
                && loc.getWorld() != null && loc.getWorld().equals(location.getWorld())) {
            it.remove();
            return;
        }
    }
}
```

## Threading

All four callbacks are invoked synchronously from the command handler, on the thread executing
`/fd debugtools`. On Paper that is the main thread. On Folia it is the thread the command dispatches on,
which owns the *sender's* region — not necessarily the region of the blocks you are about to place several
hundred metres away.

FarmersDelight's own built-in activation path is explicitly Folia-aware: it collects pending activations and
re-schedules each one onto the region owning its location. Extensions get no such treatment automatically. If
your extension touches blocks outside the sender's region on Folia, hop with
`FarmersDelightApi.get().runAtLocation(loc, ...)` yourself — noting that `place` must then return a count
before the deferred work has run, and that `undo.capture(loc)` should still happen up front on the command
thread so the capture joins the current undo batch.

Keep concurrent structures for any state shared between callbacks: `place` may run while a long `activate`
walks the same set. FDAddonTemplate uses `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()` and iterates a defensive
`new ArrayList<>(placed)` copy for exactly this reason.
