# The Skillet

The **Skillet** is a two-in-one item: a fast frying pan you place on a heat source,
and a heavy, hard-hitting **melee weapon** you can swing in a pinch.

## Crafting a Skillet

Shaped recipe (crafting table):

```
[      ] [ iron ] [ iron ]
[      ] [ iron ] [ iron ]
[ brick ] [    ] [      ]
```

- `I` = `minecraft:iron_ingot` (×4)
- `B` = `minecraft:brick` (×1)

Result: `farmersdelight:skillet` ×1.

## Frying food

The skillet fries raw food the same way a campfire does — but **faster**.

1. **Place the skillet** as a block: hold it and **sneak + right-click** a surface.
   The skillet is laid flat, facing you.
2. Make sure a **heat source** sits directly below it (a lit Stove, lit Campfire,
   Magma Block, lava, etc. — see the Stove page for the full list). A hopper directly
   under the skillet also conducts heat from a source one block further down.
3. **Right-click the placed skillet with a raw food** that has a campfire recipe to
   drop it in. Right-click again with more of the same food to stack it up.
4. When an item finishes, the cooked result **pops out** of the pan on top for you to
   collect. It cooks item by item until the pan is empty.

Right-click the pan with an **empty hand** to take the contents back out. If the heat
source goes out, cooking progress cools down until you provide heat again.

**Faster than a campfire:** the skillet applies a cook-time reduction, so food fries
more quickly than it would on a campfire. If the skillet item is enchanted with **Fire
Aspect**, cooking is faster still — each level shaves more time off (down to a minimum
cook time).

## Handheld cooking

Hold a skillet in one hand and an ingredient with a campfire recipe in the other, stand near a heat source, and hold right-click. Completion consumes one ingredient from the other hand and gives the result, dropping overflow. Releasing right-click, changing items, swapping hands, dropping, using an inventory, dying, or disconnecting interrupts cooking. Unfinished ingredients remain in place and progress is discarded.

Eating or drinking from the other hand prevents cooking from starting and interrupts an existing cook before progress advances. Vanilla consumption proceeds normally without an additional cooking debit. This applies with either hand holding the skillet.

Handheld and placed skillets share recipe times, the cooking multiplier, and the Fire Aspect bonus. With default settings and no enchantment, a 600-tick campfire recipe takes about 120 ticks (6 seconds at normal TPS).

Servers can turn handheld cooking off; see [Block behavior configuration](../../server-guide/en/block-behaviors.md) in the server guide.

## Using the Skillet as a weapon

Held in your hand, the skillet is a serious blunt weapon. Its combat stats:

- **Attack damage: 8**
- **Attack speed: 0.9** (slow, heavy swings)
- **Knockback: +1** (an extra shove on hit)

That damage is on par with the strongest swords, at the cost of a slow swing and extra
knockback that sends enemies flying. It's a fun, thematic sidearm as well as a cooking
tool.

> The skillet's item tooltip reminds you it is **placeable while sneaking** — that's
> how you set it down to fry rather than swinging it.

## Tips

- Set a skillet on a lit stove for a quick, always-on fryer next to your cooking pots.
- Fire Aspect on the skillet is worth it if you fry in bulk — it noticeably cuts cook
  time.
- In an emergency, you don't need a sword: the skillet in hand hits for 8 and knocks
  mobs back.
- Because placing needs a sneak-click, you can right-click a placed skillet normally
  to add food without accidentally picking it up.
