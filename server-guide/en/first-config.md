# First config tweaks

The defaults in `plugins/FarmersDelight/config.yml` are tuned to behave like the original mod, so a fresh
install is playable untouched. This page lists only the handful of settings **most owners change on day one**
and explains what each one does; the later sections of `config.yml` itself carry the same explanations for the
rest.

Apply changes with `/fd reload config` (or restart). Do **not** `/reload` the whole server.

## Console / log language

```yaml
language: ''
```

Empty follows the JVM/system language. Force it with `zh_cn` or `en_us`. This affects **server logs, console
text and messages with no player context** — individual players still see GUIs and chat in their own client
language. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for how the console language resolves.

## Buff display (bossbars)

```yaml
buff:
  enabled: true
  display:
    enabled: true
    channels:
      - bossbar
    layout-mode: stacked
    styles:
      nourishment: {color: GREEN, overlay: PROGRESS}
      comfort:     {color: BLUE,  overlay: PROGRESS}
```

Controls how the Nourishment/Comfort buffs (and any addon buffs) are shown. Switch `channels` to `actionbar`
or `tab_footer` if another plugin already owns the boss-bar area, or set `display.enabled: false` to keep the
effects but hide the bars.

## Effects: Nourishment / Comfort

```yaml
events:
  - on: consume
    functions:
      - type: farmersdelight:nourishment
        duration: 180
```

Food assignments now live in each item's CraftEngine configuration. Use `farmersdelight:nourishment` or
`farmersdelight:comfort` as an `on: consume` function; `duration` is in seconds. The built-in assignments are in
`plugins/CraftEngine/resources/farmersdelight/configuration/items.yml`. Global buff display, persistence and
Comfort healing settings remain in `plugins/FarmersDelight/config.yml`.

## Hopper interactions

```yaml
hopper-interactions:
  enabled: true
```

The master switch for the hopper ↔ station bridge (cooking pot, cutting board, skillet). If hoppers misbehave
with your other plugins, **turn this master switch off first** to isolate the problem, then re-enable and tune
the per-station `hopper-interactions:` toggles.

## Recipe discovery (locked recipe books)

```yaml
recipes:
  discovery:
    enabled: false
```

Off by default — every recipe is visible in the books immediately. Turn it on to make recipes start **locked**
in FarmersDelight's own cooking-pot / cutting-board viewers and reveal per-player as they unlock. Locking only
affects the book display; it never blocks crafting at a station. The `locked-display`, `unlock-on-obtain` and
`notify` keys sit under `recipes.discovery` in `config.yml`, and the addon-author
[Recipe discovery](../../api-docs/en/recipe-discovery.md) page explains what your recipes see while they are
locked.

> Recipe unlock progress is keyed by **recipe id**. Renaming a recipe id resets discovery for it. See
> [Migration & upgrades](migration.md).

## Vanilla loot injection

```yaml
loot-injection:
  install-datapack: true
```

On first enable, FarmersDelight installs a datapack that injects its items into vanilla chest / mob / grass
loot tables. Set to `false` if you manage loot tables yourself or with another plugin. The datapack needs a
restart (or `/reload` of data packs) to take effect, and your later edits to the datapack files are preserved
across plugin updates.

## Advancements

```yaml
advancements:
  enabled: true
```

Turn the whole advancement tree off with `enabled: false`. Left on, `auto-disable-missing: true` hides
advancements whose CraftEngine content you deleted so the tree stays completable. The rest of the
`advancements:` section in `config.yml` has the further knobs; see [Migration & upgrades](migration.md) for
what an update changes in an existing world.

## Where the deeper knobs live

Performance budgets, particle/sound effects, display offsets, heat sources and custom-item `container-returns`
are in `config.yml`. Mob-extra and straw drop rules are in `plugins/FarmersDelight/drops.yml`. Villager and
wandering-trader offers are in
`plugins/FarmersDelight/world-data.yml`; deleting an offer there disables it. Composting, furnace-fuel values,
pet food and food-buff assignments are in the CraftEngine item configuration. CraftEngine files are deliberately
comment-free; their field reference is in [Block behavior configuration](block-behaviors.md). You will rarely
need them on day one.
