# Server Owner Guide

[简体中文](../zh-cn/README.md)

This is the friendly getting-started flow for running **FarmersDelight** on your server: what you need, how to
install it, how to confirm it worked, the first knobs most owners touch, and how to read the console when
something is off.

It gets you from a downloaded jar to a working server and then walks the settings you are most likely to touch.
Each page links to the page that covers its topic in full: [Block behavior configuration](block-behaviors.md)
for the shipped block and item definitions, [First config tweaks](first-config.md) for `config.yml`,
[Verifying behaviours loaded](verifying.md) for reading the console, and
[Migration & upgrades](migration.md) for how updates change existing installs.

## Read in this order

1. **[Requirements & load order](requirements.md)** — Paper/Folia and Java versions, and why CraftEngine has
   to load first.
2. **[Installation](install.md)** — place the jar, first start, `/ce reload all`, and confirm the blocks and
   items exist.
3. **[Resource pack](resource-pack.md)** — how CraftEngine serves the pack, and the two failure modes you will
   actually hit.
4. **[First config tweaks](first-config.md)** — the handful of `config.yml` settings most owners change on day
   one, and what each one does.
5. **[Block behavior configuration](block-behaviors.md)** — CE block lists, tags and every configurable FD
   behavior mode.
6. **[Verifying behaviours loaded](verifying.md)** — how to read a CraftEngine behavior error, which is a
   signal that a block's config is wrong, not a crash.
7. **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)** — symptom → cause → fix, plus where the logs are.
8. **[Migration & upgrades](migration.md)** — what carries over from a fresh install or an update, and why some
   shipped files are never overwritten.

## The 60-second version

- Drop **CraftEngine** and **FarmersDelight** into `plugins/`. CraftEngine is a hard dependency and loads
  first automatically.
- Start the server once. FarmersDelight extracts its CraftEngine resources to
  `plugins/CraftEngine/resources/farmersdelight/` and its own `config.yml` to `plugins/FarmersDelight/`.
- Generate and host the resource pack the way CraftEngine documents, then run `/ce reload all`.
- Give yourself a `farmersdelight:cooking_pot` to confirm items resolve, place it, and open it.

If that all worked, you are done — jump to [First config tweaks](first-config.md). If not,
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) has you covered.
