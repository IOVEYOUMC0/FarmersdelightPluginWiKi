# Migration & upgrades

Whether you are coming fresh from the original mod or upgrading an existing FarmersDelight install, these are
the things that behave differently from "just overwrite the files". This page covers the operational rules;
for what a shipped block definition changes between versions, read the block's own entry under
`plugins/CraftEngine/resources/farmersdelight/configuration/` before you accept the new file.

## Coming from the mod

This is a **port**, not the mod. Intended gameplay matches Farmer's Delight, but only what these CraftEngine
configs actually ship exists on your server. Worlds are ordinary Paper/Folia worlds — there is no mod-world
import step. Install the plugins, generate the pack, and the content appears. Crops, stations, foods and
recipes are placed and crafted in-game exactly as a player would expect.

## Recipe ids are save keys

Recipe unlock progress (when `recipes.discovery.enabled: true`) is stored **per recipe id**. Treat a recipe's
id as a stable save key:

- **Renaming** a recipe id makes discovery see it as a brand-new recipe — players lose the "unlocked" state on
  the old id.
- Keep ids stable across your own edits if you use discovery, or accept that a rename resets that recipe's
  unlock state.

## Config auto-migrates renamed keys

On every startup FarmersDelight reconciles your `config.yml` against the one the running build ships, **without
changing any value you set**:

- keys the new build **renamed** are moved to their new name, carrying your value;
- keys the new build **retired** are removed;
- settings **added** by the update are merged in, with their explanatory comments.

So after a plugin update you do **not** need to hand-migrate `config.yml` — your tuned values survive, new
settings appear at their defaults, and dead keys are cleaned up. (A backup failure during this process is
reported in the log rather than aborting the update.)

Villager and wandering-trader offers now live in `world-data.yml`. Mob-extra and straw drop rules now live in
`drops.yml`. When a legacy `config.yml` still contains either `world-data:` or `drops:`, the section is moved to
the matching file automatically. The affected files are backed up before the move; edit the standalone files after
that point.

## Shipped files are installed only when absent

Three different "install only if missing" rules matter when upgrading, because they mean **your edits to
shipped content survive updates but new shipped content may not arrive on its own**:

### CraftEngine resources

The full built-in resources are extracted **once**, on the first start. After that:

```yaml
craftengine-resources:
  auto-completion: true
```

`auto-completion: true` (default) **restores deleted/missing** resource files on later startups — but never
overwrites files that are present. If you intentionally deleted some shipped configs and don't want them
re-added, set this to `false`. Either way, **files you edited in place are never overwritten**, so a plugin
update that changes a shipped block/recipe file will *not* land on a server that already has that file —
merge such changes by hand (or delete the file and let auto-completion restore the new version).

### Recipe files

```yaml
recipes:
  merge-missing-bundled: false
```

A recipe file is written **only when it is entirely missing**. Recipes added by an update never reach a server
that already has `recipes/*.yml`. On startup the ids that exist in the jar but not on disk are listed once in
the console. To pull those new ids in, set `merge-missing-bundled: true` — but leave it **false** if you
deleted recipes on purpose, because merging brings every deleted recipe back. An id already on disk is never
overwritten under either setting.

### Loot-injection datapack

Installed into each world on first enable and then left alone — your later edits to the datapack files survive
plugin updates. See [First config](first-config.md).

## Upgrade checklist

1. Stop the server (`/stop`) — do not hot-swap the jar.
2. Replace both the FarmersDelight jar and, if updated, the resource pack.
3. Start the server. Let `config.yml`, `world-data.yml` and `drops.yml` auto-migrate and CraftEngine resources auto-complete.
4. Read the console: check the *Content ready* line and the one-time "missing bundled recipe" notice; decide
   whether you want those recipes (`merge-missing-bundled`).
5. If the update changed shipped CE resource files you had edited, merge those changes by hand.
6. Regenerate the pack (`/ce reload all`) and confirm textures in-game.
7. Skim the release notes for the build you installed; a block-level change that needs a manual step is called
   out there.
